Elimination Game is a multiplayer text-based game designed after the Alice in Borderland's King of Hearts game.

How-to-Play:
A typical game consists of a traitor being chosen at the beginning at random. Each round, each player will receive one of the following card symbols 
(spades, clubs, diamonds, and hearts), but it is not available for them to see. Other players will be able to see their symbol using a list of players with
their associated symbols being displayed in the web page. Players must tell one another what symbol they have in order for them to learn their own symbol.
Each round will take X amount of minutes and by the end of the timer, players must enter the symbol they believe they have. The game ends when either the 
traitor and one other is alive or the traitor is eliminated.

        <h1>About Last Card Standing</h1>

        <p>"Last Card Standing" is an intense and strategic online card game where players compete to be the last one standing. The game is played with a standard deck of playing cards and can accommodate 2 to 6 players.</p>

        <h2>Setup:</h2>

        <p>Players join a virtual lobby, and the game server handles the setup automatically. Each player is dealt an equal number of cards from the virtual deck. The remaining cards form the draw pile, managed by the game server.</p>

        <h2>Gameplay:</h2>

        <p>The game proceeds in turns, with each player taking their turn sequentially. On their turn, players have two options:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Play a card: Players can play a card from their hand onto the discard pile if it matches the suit or rank of the top card on the discard pile. If a player cannot play a card, they must draw a card from the draw pile. If the drawn card can be played, the player can immediately play it; otherwise, their turn ends.</li>
            <li>Use a special action card: Throughout the deck, there are special action cards that allow players to perform various actions, such as skip a player's turn, reverse the direction of play, force a player to draw additional cards, or even eliminate another player from the game.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Elimination:</h2>

        <p>The game continues until only one player remains. Players are eliminated from the game if they:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Cannot play a card and the draw pile runs out.</li>
            <li>Are forced to draw cards beyond a certain limit (e.g., five cards) due to special action cards.</li>
            <li>Are targeted by an elimination action card played by another player.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Strategy:</h2>

        <p>To increase their chances of survival, players must carefully manage their hand, strategically play their cards, and anticipate the moves of their opponents. They must also be mindful of the special action cards and use them strategically to gain an advantage or eliminate their rivals.</p>

        <p>The last player remaining after all others have been eliminated is declared the winner of "Last Card Standing."</p>

        <p>"Last Card Standing" offers a blend of luck and strategy, making it a thrilling and competitive online card game for players of all ages. Will you outsmart your opponents and emerge as the ultimate survivor, or will you fall victim to cunning tactics and swift eliminations?</p>
